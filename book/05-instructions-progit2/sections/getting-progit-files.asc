=== Getting the progit2 Files

Use Git to clone the {progit2-source} to your computer. Since we are interested in the book as a _template_ we use `--depth 1` to avoid downloading the editing history for the project. We also give the project a new name `new-book-project` so that it can serve as a template for our own book project.

```console
$ git clone --depth 1 --origin source https://github.com/progit/progit2.git new-book-project
```

If you have not done so already, run the `docker pull` command below to download the {booksquisher-docker-hub-image}. If you have already installed the Booksquisher Docker image, this command will check to see that it is the latest version, and will download the latest if a newer version is available.

```console
$ docker pull marmor/booksquisher
```
