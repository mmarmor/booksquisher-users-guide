=== Build System Differences: Pro Git 2 vs. Booksquisher Templates

There are a few key differences between the build system in the {booksquisher-templates} and the {progit2-source} that you should be aware of:

. In the Booksquisher Example Book Templates the generated books are placed into the `generated-output` directory. In _Pro Git 2_ the generated books are placed into the _top level directory_ of the project.

. The Booksquisher templates have a _clean_ command that you can use as part of the build process. The _Pro Git 2_ build process does not have this command. Here is how the _clean_ command works in the {booksquisher-templates}:
+
To delete *all* of the generated book files and intermediate build artifacts you can run:
+
```console
[booksquisher]# bundle exec rake book:clean
```
This should remove everything from the `generated-output` directory except for the hidden `.gitignore` file.
+
You can combine the process of removing old book versions _and_ generating new ones into a single command like this:
+
```console
[booksquisher]# bundle exec rake book:clean book:build
```
