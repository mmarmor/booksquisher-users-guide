=== A Few Tips Before we Start Editing

* Build the book template before you start modifying it and make sure that it builds properly and without any errors. Examine the generated files and see if you like the formatting and output. Make a few small changes to the template and then build the book again. If the book does not build the way that you are expecting, try to figure out why (and fix it!) before making any other modifications to the template. Working in small iterative steps is the best way to get started.

* Use a text editor that you are already comfortable using. Don't try to learn a new text editor _and_ Booksquisher at the same time. Which text editor is best is a topic where people have strong personal opinions. Because of that, I have moved the discussion about text editors to the <<ch06-helpful-tips#ch06-helpful-tips>> chapter in the section <<ch06-helpful-tips#_text_editors>>. Here I'll limit myself to one sentence: If you don't already have a favorite text editor I suggest you use {vs-code}, which is free, easy to learn, runs on all major platforms, and has great support--via extensions--for AsciiDoc, Git, and code spell checking.

* Rather than immediately removing the existing content of the templates consider commenting them out until you have a working replacement. So rather than just deleting or editing `include::ch01-name.asc[]` comment it out with `//`:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
// include::ch01-name.asc[]
----
+
Put your version right below the commented out version so you can compare the two.
+
If you want to comment out large sections of the template file, you can use block comments:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
////
This multi-line block will not
appear in the rendered output.
////
----

* You can put sub-sections of a chapter into multiple files to make large books easier to manage. There is an example of this in the `book-template-1-simple` Booksquisher Template in the file `ch02-name.asc`. Look for the code that looks like:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::book/02-name/sections/example-section-to-be-included.asc[]
----
+
Organize sections in the book directory in clearly named chapter directories and files. In the example above it is easy to see that this is a section of chapter two. This description sounds complicated, but it is not. Examine the structure of the example templates to see how sub-sections of chapters are included. If you want to see a very complex example, take a look at the {progit2-source}.

* When designing a book cover image you might want to try {canva}, which is web-based graphic design software. The free-tier of Canva will allow you to create a beautiful looking book cover with minimal effort. Start by creating a custom sized image with a width of 1050 px and a height of 1600 px (16:9 resolution). Once you have started a new blank canvas of this size (which is typical for Kindle cover images), search Canva for “Book Cover.” When you select a cover template, it will be resized to fit your 1050 px x 1600 px image. (Note that most of Canva’s Book Cover templates are 1410 px x 2250 px, which is the size of a typical paper-back book.) When you are done designing your image download it in PNG format. You can rename it to `cover.png` and use it instead of the default image in the `book` sub-directory of your Booksquisher Template.

* You can learn more about <<ch06-helpful-tips#_working_with_git_github_and_book_templates>> in the <<ch06-helpful-tips#ch06-helpful-tips>> chapter. Specifically, that section shows you how to remove Git tracking from a template and create your own repository on your local computer and on GitHub.
