=== Edit the Booksquisher Template

Now that we have made a plan for our book and have some basic structural ideas in mind, let's modify the `book-template-1-simple` Booksquisher Template to reflect our decisions.

To change the name of the book, the author, and to define which chapter files to include:

. Rename the primary “spine” book file from `my-book-name.asc` to the name you want for your primary book file (for example, `my-fabulous-novel.asc`).

. Open your new book file (`my-fabulous-novel.asc`) with the text editor of your choice, and change the name at the top of the file to the proper name of your book. In this case “My Book Name: A Booksquisher Template” becomes “My Fabulous Novel.”

. Adjust the number of equal signs below the name to match the exact length of the new title.

. Change the author name from “A. Nonymous” to your name.

. Change the include directive for the first chapter from `include::ch01-name.asc[]` to the file name you want to use for your first chapter (for example, `include::ch01-dirty-harmonica.asc[]`). Repeat this for each chapter that you have already decided.

. Notice that the book cover image is set up with the line `:front-cover-image: image:book/cover.png[width=1050,height=1600]`. You can find the `cover.png` image in the `book` sub-directory. If you use a book cover image with other dimensions you should put the appropriate dimensions here. Note that 1050 px x 1600 px (16:9 resolution) is a typical Amazon Kindle cover size.

Notice all the other settings in your primary book file (`my-fabulous-novel.asc` or whatever you have named the main file for your book). There is a *lot* you can do here, which you can learn about in the {asciidoctor-writers-guide}.

Now we will edit the `Rakefile`, which defines the build process. We need to change the name of the book to make it consistent with your new primary book file (for example, “my-book-name” gets changed to “my-fabulous-novel”). The line in the `Rakefile` will look like this:

```asciidoc
book_name = 'my-fabulous-novel'
```

Next, we need a text file for each chapter you defined. The name of the chapter file needs to match the include directive that you defined in the primary book file. For example, you can rename `ch01-name.asc` to `ch01-dirty-harmonica.asc`. Since this Booksquisher template only has a few chapters, you will need to create new files, or copy existing chapter files and rename them as needed.

You can model the content of each chapter file after the template. When in doubt about syntax look at the {asciidoctor-writers-guide} and then, if you want to go deeper, the {asciidoctor-user-manual}.
