=== Make a Plan

It is helpful to have a plan for your book before you start modifying a book template for your use. Even if you do not have book content created yet, you will still need to define the structure of your book, at least partially, before you can work with it in Booksquisher. If you are like most people, you will need to change the structure of your book many times as your ideas evolve, so don't let the planning process paralyze you.

Here is one plan of attack:

. Define the name of your book (“My Fabulous Novel”).

. Define the primary filename of your book (“my-fabulous-novel”). All the various final-formatted versions will use this filename, for example, `my-fabulous-novel.epub`, `my-fabulous-novel.pdf`, `my-fabulous-novel.html`, etc.

. Decide on the names of the first few chapters and the main sections of each chapter. (“Chapter 1: The Dirty Harmonica” has two sections: “Kansas” and “BBQ Sauce”).
