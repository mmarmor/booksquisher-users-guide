=== You are Doing Great!

If you have made it this far, congratulations! Your next mission--should you choose to accept it--is to modify the example templates so that they are useful as a starting point for creating your own books. We will cover that process in the next section <<ch04-modifying-bs-templates#ch04-modifying-bs-templates>>.

As I mentioned before, a huge percentage of books can be created by simply modifying the Booksquisher Example Book Templates. More sophisticated markup syntax can be learned by reading the {asciidoctor-writers-guide} on the Asciidoctor website. If you want to dive deeper, check out the {asciidoctor-user-manual}.

Now that you know how to build the {booksquisher-templates}, you can easily build the _{progit2-book}_ book. _Pro Git 2_ is a 500+ page monster compared to the example templates, but the concepts are the same. If you want to see what you can accomplish with AsciiDoc and this build system, build the {progit2-project} and study the book source. The section <<ch05-instructions-progit2#ch05-instructions-progit2>> walks you through the process, but with a little less explanation than we have given here for the Booksquisher Example Book Templates. You can also try building the {booksquisher-users-guide-source} -- the book you are reading now.
