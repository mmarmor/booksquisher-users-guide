=== Calling The `asciidoctor` Commands Directly

The authors of the {progit2-project} build system want you to build the _Pro Git 2_ book by calling `bundle exec rake book:build`. They want you to use `bundle` to make sure that the exact required versions of toolchain programs, as they have defined them, are used. This helps keep book builds repeatable and cuts down on rendering related issues. This is important for large projects with lots of contributors. The authors want the generated book to look correct and consistent regardless of who builds it. You may want that too and can adapt their build process for your book project. In fact, I strongly recommend that you use the build process that is used in the {booksquisher-templates}, which is based on what you will find in the {progit2-project}.

That said, there are other ways that you can invoke the tools in the Booksquisher Docker container. In a less formal setting, you might want to use the underlying commands that build individual output formats. An alternative to calling the `bundle` command is to call the `asciidoctor` family of commands directly.

The commands below use the `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf` and `asciidoctor-epub` command-line programs in the Booksquisher Docker container.

To build a book with HTML5 formatted output, use the command:

```console
[booksquisher]# asciidoctor mybook.asc
```

To learn more about the `asciidoctor` command, see the {asciidoctor-org} website.  

To build a book with PDF formatted output, use the command:

```console
[booksquisher]# asciidoctor-pdf mybook.asc
```

To learn more about the options for `asciidoctor-pdf` see the {asciidoctor-pdf} website.

To build a book with EPUB3 formatted output, use the command:

```console
[booksquisher]# asciidoctor-epub3 mybook.asc
```

To build a book with Kindle (KF8/MOBI/AZW3) formatted output, use the command:

```console
[booksquisher]# asciidoctor-epub3 -a ebook-format=kf8 mybook.asc
```

To learn more about the options for `asciidoctor-epub3` for generating both EPUB3 and Kindle files see the {asciidoctor-epub3} website.
