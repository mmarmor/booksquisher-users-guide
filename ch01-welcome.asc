There are a _lot_ of great open source tools for creating books. Booksquisher is different because it is a _system_ rather than just a set of tools. Booksquisher brings together four essential elements to create an easy-to-use book creation _method_:

. *The best tools, pre-selected*. Just figuring out which tools and technology to use among the sea of good choices is a real challenge! The “engine” of Booksquisher is a tool called Asciidoctor, which we believe is the best open source option available today.

. *Useful example books*. Booksquisher comes with simplified book templates based on a successfully published “real-world” book (called Pro Git, 2nd Edition). You can use these templates, or the “real” book, as a model for books of your own.

. *Everything you need is pre-installed*. Booksquisher is a “Docker container,” which means that it already has all the tools, obscure libraries, and software dependencies installed, configured, and pre-packaged. You can run Booksquisher on Windows, Mac, and Linux since all these systems can run Docker.

. *Step-by-step documentation*. The Booksquisher User's Guide shows you _every_ command you need to produce and manage great looking books in multiple standard formats. The documentation covers the system end-to-end, all in one place.

=== Quick Overview

If you are looking for a well-designed system for writing books in one master format and allowing the computer to generate great looking, ready-to-publish versions in EPUB3, AZW3/MOBI (Kindle Format 8), PDF, and HTML5, then Booksquisher is for you. Don't “roll your own” book building system. Use the same open source system that super-smart people have already battle-tested in the real world.

The Booksquisher Docker image was originally created to provide a ready-to-run toolchain for building the open source book _Pro Git, 2nd Edition_, written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. You can still use it for making the _Pro Git 2_ book. That said, you can _also_ use the Docker image and associated Example Book Templates to create *your own* books based on the same fantastic technology stack and build approach as _Pro Git 2_.

The Booksquisher Example Book Templates are simplifications of the same markup language, book structure, and build system used by the _Pro Git 2_ book. (Except they are only a few pages long instead of 500+ pages, so they are way easier to figure out when you are getting started!)

The documentation in this User's Guide explains step-by-step how to use the tools in the Booksquisher Docker image to generate finished books from the Booksquisher Example Book Templates, as well as the _Pro Git 2_ book source code.

Booksquisher is a containerized, multi-format book creation system based on Asciidoctor and the build scripts used to generate the open source book _Pro Git, 2nd Edition_. Booksquisher consists of a Docker image containing all the tools, Example Book Templates, and this User's Guide. You can use Booksquisher anywhere that you can run Docker, which includes computers running Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

=== Introduction

The {booksquisher-docker-hub-image} contains the toolchain and core dependencies required for building the English language version of the book _{progit2-book}_ by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. The AsciiDoc source for the _Pro Git 2_ book as well as the build scripts are located on GitHub in the {progit2-project}.

The progit2 project uses an excellent build system for generating high-quality EPUB3, MOBI (Kindle Format 8, also called AZW3), PDF, and HTML5 books from a single source. The book content is written in {asciidoc-org}. The tools in the Booksqisher Docker image convert this AsciiDoc into beautiful books in multiple formats. The authors clearly learned a lot from creating the first edition of the _Pro Git_ book, which used a different markdown language and toolchain (based on pandoc). We can all benefit from their experience by studying their AsciiDoc source and using their build system as a template. _Pro Git 2_ is a high-profile open source book, and given its subject, it receives a lot of attention and collaborative input from seriously-smart developers. A lot of capable eyes have reviewed the book source and build system.

The Booksquisher Docker image and Example Book Templates give you an easy way to use the *structure* behind the _Pro Git 2_ AsciiDoc source and build system as a model for creating books of your own. Booksquisher provides the tools, examples, and documentation you need to get started and focus on writing rather than the technical mechanics of generating formatted books.

=== Background

When I first started working with the _Pro Git 2_ build system, I had a bear of a time getting all the tools and dependencies set up correctly. Once I figured out all the details and dependencies, I created a Docker image to containerize all the requirements into a package I could reuse easily on any platform.

.A technical note you can safely ignore:
NOTE: I later discovered the {asciidoctor-docker} Docker image which contains most, but not all the needed tools. The {booksquisher-docker-hub-image} is now based on the {asciidoctor-docker} image as a parent.

I created the Booksquisher Docker image as a convenience for my own use. I hope you find it useful as well. The Docker image itself consists of minor additions to the work of others. What you are reading now is the documentation that I wish I had as I banged my head on the keyboard in frustration trying to get the _Pro Git 2_ book to build without errors and then to render correctly. In the process of figuring this out, I've gained a bit of knowledge that I'd like to pass on in these notes. I want technically capable writers to be able to use Booksquisher as a “black box” book creation system without needing to dive into the specifics of the underlying toolchain. Ideally, you should not need to know that the underlying system is Alpine Linux, or what version of Ruby is running in the container.

A huge percentage of books can be created by simply modifying the Booksquisher example book templates. More sophisticated markup syntax can be learned by reading the {asciidoctor-writers-guide} on the Asciidoctor website. If you want to dive deeper, check out the {asciidoctor-user-manual}. If you procrastinate (like I do) by geeking out on open source tech, spend your time on mastering Asciidoctor-specific markup rather than figuring out underlying build dependencies! (This entire project was fueled by procrastination energy; I know of what I speak.)

=== Summary: Why You Need the Booksquisher Docker Image

You need the Booksquisher Docker image so that you can get up and running with a battle-tested book creation process without spending days figuring out how to get the tools to work. You still need to be a rock-star-ninja computer user, since you will be creating your book in AsciiDoc and using the command line. The Booksquisher Docker image gives you a machine-independent toolchain configuration and environment that is known to work. That will save you time, I promise.
