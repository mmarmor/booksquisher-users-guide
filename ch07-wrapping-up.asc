I work with companies to build offshore software development teams around the world. If you are considering nearshore or offshore development in Asia, Latin America, or Eastern Europe, I can make connections and coach you through the process.

Since 1999 I have spent about half of my time overseas on various software and IT projects. I'm American--based in Charlotte, North Carolina--but I have lived and worked in six Indian cities and the Himalayan country of Bhutan. (As I write this I am currently in Goa, India enjoying the wonderful February weather!)

I am a serious yoga practitioner, an amateur bluegrass mandolin player, a ham radio operator, a learning photographer, and an aspiring writer. My email address is my last name at gmail.com--please feel free to reach out to me.

==== What Instigated this Project?

I've been working with document production systems for a long time. I've documented software and even created large RFP projects with LaTeX in the old days, then DocBook, and more recently reStructuredText with Sphinx, and Pandoc. I decided I want to do more public writing in 2019, so in January I spent some time getting up to date on current open source toolchains and comparing them with commercial tools like Scrivener, which I bought a few years ago for a writing project. I looked at what high-profile open source books had been released and what tools they used. I discovered the well-respected book Pro Git, 1st Edition was written using Markdown and compiled with Pandoc, but wholly rewritten in AsciiDoc and compiled with Asciidoctor for the 2nd Edition. These Pro Git guys are smart, so I studied how they wrote and generated the 2nd Edition book on GitHub. Getting all the required tools to run to build the book without errors or rendering problems was a PITA, so when I finally cracked the nut and figured it out, I documented it by creating a Dockerfile to automatically build an environment I could use myself to generate books with the same structure as Pro Git, 2nd Edition. At some point, I realized that what I had put together was useful in and of itself, so I started documenting it and creating a User's Guide. My wife Anna helped me come up with the name; I registered the domain, designed a logo, and we put it up on Netlify using Booksquisher itself to generate a website version of the User's Guide. The next step is to improve and add additional book templates.
